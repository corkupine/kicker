# A project for college bound kickers

This is my second pass at this project. My first attempt, I hired a friend to help me with a PHP version. Everything worked like a charm, as expected. The issue was that I was manually updating a JSON file, and had to wait until after the game. I wanted something I could update *during* the game. That's how this got redeveloped. I went with Ruby on Rails, well, because I wanted to learn Rails.

This project is broken down into 6 main sections (the basics of what coaches want to see):

* Kickoffs
* Field Goals
* PATs
* Punts
* Highlight videos
* Static Pages (home page and bio)

With the exception of the static pages, these are all simple data entry forms that will calculate meaningful statistics upon entry.

## Future Considerations

* Flickr API for possible image gallery
* Youtube API for Highlights
